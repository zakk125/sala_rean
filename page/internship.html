            * STUDENT INTERNSHIP PROGRAME
        </div>
        <div style="font-size: 17px;"><br>
            During the last semester of the 4th Year, Students will be 
            exposed to the working environment where they are expected 
            to undertake various activities in the organizations that 
            they are attached to. The Student Internship program (SIP) 
            is an integral part of our curriculum. The 16-week immersion 
            in a working environment will not only enhance the students' 
            understanding of the application of the relevant IT discipline 
            in an organization, but will also provide an opportunity for 
            them to grow into responsible working adults.
        </div>
        <div style="font-size: 17px;"><br>
            The SIP provides students with an opportunity to apply and 
            integrate the knowledge and skills acquired during their 
            study. Students will be assigned work which requires them 
            to demonstrate independence, initiative, creativity and 
            strong conceptual thinking and proficiency.
